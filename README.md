#### Product Vision:

For anyone who is planning an event like a birthday party, wedding, or conference, the application Eventique is a web app that works on a browser on any device. It provides Artificial intelligence to supercharge your event planning in minutes with a recommender, scheduler, organizer, and notification system. Unlike other event management companies (such as Cvent, EventPro, and Bizzabo) which don’t have recommendation systems, are pricey and take a lot of time, our product provides a platform to design your event quickly in a way you would like within a few minutes.
Development Platform: Hardware - min 4GB RAM, 4 cores. OS - Windows/Ubuntu
